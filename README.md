Not much to see yet. Still following through the libtcod Python tutorial as part of [https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/grccvt/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/]

## Development

To get started, do:

```sh
npm i
npm run start
```

You should get a browser window with the 'game' running.

## Ideas

- `#say love` kinda like Elbereth for at least the deadly flying glove?
- **classes** = starting instruments?
- **apple bonkers**: being hit by several apples makes you unable to move for a while (stuck in pile), can be lethal if too many apples
- **sea of holes**:
  - each floor tile is a 'stairs down' that sends you to another tile (random? chosen at roomgen?)
  - except for one tile which is green, the actual exit
  - some floor tiles are "holes in your pocket" that you can pick up
- **sea of monsters**: most enemies are random colours/letters "an indescribable monster", rolly guy, vacuum flask, "a really ugly monster"
- **sea of time**: "you can hear your beard growing"
- **sea of science**: cubes??
- **nowhere**: if eaten by vacuum flask?
- **pepperland**: many items trapped in anti-music missiles, can be opened with a "hole in your pocket"

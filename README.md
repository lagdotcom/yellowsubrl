Not much to see yet. Still following through the libtcod Python tutorial as part of [https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/grccvt/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/]

## Development

To get started, do:

```sh
npm i
npm run start
```

You should get a browser window with the 'game' running.
